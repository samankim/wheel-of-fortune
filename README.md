# wheel-of-fortune
Wheel of Fortune project from CS106A (Hangman extension)

This project was created in CS106A (Programming Methodology). My project partner and I created Wheel of Fortune 
as an extension on the class assignment "Hangman". This program uses the acm.graphics packages. We received the 
highest grade possible on this assignment (++) - only a few of these are given each quarter.
