# wheel-of-fortune
Wheel of Fortune project from CS106A (Hangman extension)

This project was created in the class CS106A (Programming Methodology) at Stanford and uses the acm.graphics packages. My project partner and I created Wheel of Fortune as an extension on the class assignment "Hangman". We received the highest grade possible on this assignment (++) - only a few of these are given each quarter.
